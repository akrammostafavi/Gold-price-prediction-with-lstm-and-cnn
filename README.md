# Gold Price Forecasting with Deep Learning (Ongoing PhD Research)

This repository presents an overview of an ongoing PhD project focused on forecasting gold prices using deep learning techniques.

The research investigates hybrid neural network models that combine sequential modeling and feature extraction, and explores uncertainty estimation to enhance prediction reliability.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Predict future gold prices based on historical financial data
- Apply hybrid deep learning models (e.g., LSTM + Conv2D)
- Evaluate and quantify uncertainty in predictions
- Analyze performance using multiple evaluation metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

- Python (planned)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 🔍 Status

This project is currently under development and forms part of my PhD thesis.  
Final implementation and results will be published after academic review, expected by **Summer 2025**.
